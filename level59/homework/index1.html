            I'm a writer, speaker and raw vegan activist who educates  and guides people who are sick and tired of feeling "sick  and tired" and are ready to take more control over their  health and experience the compassionate lifestyle one can  achieve by living FullyRaw. 
            </p>
            
            
           <p class="div6">FullyRaw is not just a diet. Its a lifestyle. I like to think of this way of eating as an awakening and way of rediscovering connection with ourselves, with others, and  with our earth. I really believe it begins with food, and then it becomes a mind, body, and spirit transformation. It's a  way for you to build the foundation that will lead you to a  healthier, happier, and more abundant life. I'm here to help  guide you through the journey of returning to yourself. As  you dive into these programs, the recipes, the videos, the  workshops and more, you're going to discover just how  powerful fruits and vegetables really are for our bodies. I truly believe that food is medicine because I have seen its  substantial transformational abilities myself. It's a mind,  body, spirit journey.pr </p>

        At the age of 16, I was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, more specifically, hyperglycemia. It was devastating to think this would be something I would suffer from for the rest of my life. That wasn't good enough for me. I was determined to find a way to take control of how I was feeling and live a fuller life where I wasn't bogged down with the symptoms of hyperglycemia.
